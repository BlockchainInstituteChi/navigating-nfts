  <p>There have been various long standing issues that have plagued the ticketing industry. Whether it be a small concert venue or a large stadium, ticketing is a part of most events. While the space has moved into the digital world, with websites like StubHub and the major sports franchises offering digital downloads. However one of the biggest issues faced by the ticketing industry has to do with the purchase of fraudulent tickets.</p>

<p>There is no worse feeling than getting to the gate of an event that you're super excited to go to, only to be told the tickets you bought from a third party are faked. You pull out our tickets, but the barcode won't scan. You're left confused, then irritated. The venue isn't happy about turning you away.</p>

<p>While this was a lot more common of an occurrence before the digitization of tickets, the problem still persists. If people don't go to the correct website by falling for phishing scams, they can end up paying real money for fake tickets.</p>

<p>This alone gives us a problem that blockchain ticketing can possibly address, but it is mainly one that benefits the consumer. While this can sometimes be enough to get a corporation to act, if they have their own separate incentive, they are much more likely to implement that solution. Luckily, blockchain ticketing can solve a problem for vendors as well.</p>

<p>The ticketing industry brings in more than $14 billion in revenue per year, but a lot of value is exchanged via the resale market. There is nothing preventing someone from acting as a middle-man profiting by buying the ticket from the event venue and selling it on the open market for a profit. These ticket resellers have become part of the industry, with StubHub and SeatGeek standing out as some of the most popular online marketplaces for resellers to post their available tickets. The problem for the venues selling these tickets? They don't see any portion of the continued sale of their ticket.</p>

<p>Turning a ticket into an NFT could allow for a he ability for a royalty to be collected every time the ticket is resold. This isn't an idea being floated around by just anyone. Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, has announced that he is considering an NFT based ticketing system that allows the Mavericks to monetize future sales. This isn't Cuban's first exploration into NFTs. He has been part of Lazy.com, a marketplace for NFTs like Rarible and OpenSea.</p>

<p>There is nothing preventing sports franchises and venues from turning their digital tickets into NFTs. With the ability of collect revenue on successive sales, we are likely to see more ticket issues look towards an NFT-based solution.</p>
