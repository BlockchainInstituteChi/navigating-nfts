    <p>Who doesn't like art? For one, it's aesthetically pleasing and is often a great decorating piece for your home. One would think that the art market would clash with an increasingly digital world, but a rather interesting thing has happened. The rise of art-based NFTs has coincided with the rise of a digital art market.</p>

<p>Art maintains its value because a market agrees upon that value. This is the case for many NFTs, they simply are worth something because people currently believe they are worth something. That's how market value is set. Although unorthodox, this principle also extends to digital art, emboldened by a growing digital art community. We've already seen notable NFT-based art being sold by the world famous Christie's Auction House.</p>

<p>The most notable example of an NFT piece being sold as art by Christie's would be artist Beeple's Everyday: The first 5000 days. While it is considered one piece, it is made up of 5000 separate images created by Beeple, a new one being created each day for over 13 years!</p>

<p>Christie's describes the piece as being "created over 5,000 days by the groundbreaking artist, this monumental collage was the first purely digital artwork (NFT) ever offered at Christieâ€™s."</p>

<p>What made this unique besides being the first digital artwork sold by Christie's? Its price tag. 5000 days was recently sold for nearly $70,000,000, with the transfer of ownership being signified by an NFT.</p>

<p>What are the implications? If art can be tokenized and transferred via decentralized networks, a robust art trading market can arise. We might see art traders as we see crypto day traders. A lot of questions are being asked about NFTs holding their value. The answer to those questions depends on the utility of the NFT, as well as the community surrounding the token. The digital art market is growing rapidly as interest increases. Digital art backed by NFTs are likely to stick around for a while as the digital art community has established a market where these pieces have value. </p>
