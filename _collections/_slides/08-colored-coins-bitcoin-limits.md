  <p>The same data processing capability we just referenced would ultimately be a limiting factor in the progress of colored coins. A feature known as Simple Payment Verification allowed the Bitcoin chain to only reference part of the history to check the state of the chain, or who has what at a given time. The tool was adopted, allowing the amount of data that has to be sifted through to come from the latest part of the chain as opposed to going back through the entire history of the chain. This would be a lot of work just to verify the last state of the chain. This tool was implemented and worked fine with Bitcoin, helping limit the data used by the chain. However, this change effectively killed the colored coins project, as each color coin had to be tracked from its inception in order to determine what it was specifically earmarked for. Additionally part of the incentive structure relies on miners competing over compiling the transfer of fungible units. NFTs may represent something very valuable, and could theoretically be more attractive to miners to reverse.</p>

<p>As soon as these barriers proved to be more than the project could overcome, many developers looked elsewhere for a solution. That solution would result in the creation of another, more data-focused, blockchain.</p>
