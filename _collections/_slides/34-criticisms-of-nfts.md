  <p>Some have brought up valid criticisms when it comes to NFTs. One complaint is the artificial scarcity of NFTs ultimately gives them an unsustainable value. In 2018, we saw the end of the ICO bubble, but we did not see the end of ICOs. The frequency and magnitude were reduced, but many projects went on to have success in using an ICO after this period, and are still thriving today.</p> 

<p>Influencer and collector extraordinaire Gary Vee has made the claim that 97% of NFTs will not survive long term. That's a staggering claim at first glance, but remember, NFTs can be created by anyone. If you or I create a random NFT, it might be difficult to persuade users that it will have a long term value. Interestingly enough, despite his assessment, Gary Vee is working on minting and selling his very own NFTs. So his belief can be broken down like this: many NFTs have no utility or collectible value, so many will ultimately become worthless. But there is profit to be made by the remaining 3%. It's a matter of identifying them, which admittedly is easier said than done.</p>

<p>So which NFTs are likely to have the best chance at success? It's hard to tell, but an early assessment shows that NFTs with utility that allow a certain privilege are likely to see some success, depending on the project. It's not hard to see how the ability for continued monetization, or receiving royalties via smart contract, might convince enterprising individuals, groups, and organizations to explore implementing NFTs.</p>

<p>Predicting the direction of collectible NFTs is a little more tricky. Some of these projects are given value because of the organizations that are backing them. For example, NBA Top Shot cards have value because of the licensing provided by the NBA. Rare collectibles issued by bands may maintain value because of the popularity of the group.</p>

<p>A collectible with an interesting history can have increased value over a similar one with a less colorful backstory. Collectibles that can be used in a game setting, where certain cards have unique abilities, uses, and rarities have their value tied to the popularity of their game. Art that has its value supported by existing communities may have a better chance at sustaining that value. All of these collectibles still have communities and associations that are likely to help sustain the market for these NFTs.</p>

<p>However, NFTs that I describe as collectibles for the sake of collectibles, ones that do not have any specific use, may struggle to maintain their value. This could be where we see some or much of an NFTs value lost.</p>

<p>Another factor into the value and interest in NFTs is the overall popularity and familiarity of cryptocurrency. Since NFTs are transferred just as fungible cryptocurrencies, users need a basic understanding of the tools of the blockchain. We're seeing the user base grow slowly but steadily, with some spikes in interest over time. What is clear is that there are more and more proficient crypto users, and that growth can help the popularity of NFTs.</p>
