  <p>This brings us to another misconception that fuels the first: NFTs are created locally and are stored on a server, not on the blockchain. Some might point out that this is an element of centralization, but complete decentralization isn't necessary or prioritized when creating NFTs. Additionally, ownership is still tracked through a decentralized blockchain where users can utilize their private and public keys in order to store and transfer NFTs like they would with any crypto.</p>
