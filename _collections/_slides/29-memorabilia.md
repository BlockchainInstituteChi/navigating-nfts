  <p>The current memorabilia market is rife with fraud, mainly because of how certificates of authenticity work. A certificate of authenticity is a paper document that is issued at the time the memorabilia is signed or put up for sale. Certificates are issued by trusted authorities within the space and are effective ways to prove ownership, this is how the memorabilia industry operates.</p>

<p>The only problem: If you lose that certificate, there is no record of authenticity for the item. You might as well toss out the piece considering you can no longer prove it is an authentic item. This small paper’s significance is immense; the item retains its value as long as the certificate is kept. As you can imagine, there have been some of these certificates that have been lost or destroyed. Getting them recertified is nearly impossible, as most of these certificates are issued at the time the memorabilia is signed or recorded. How can this problem be mitigated? NFTs. If the certificate of authenticity is digitally issued, it can’t be destroyed. As long as the holder retains the keys associated with the NFT, they will always have proof of authenticity.</p> 

<p>When Americans think about some of the most notable sports memorabilia, baseball trading cards instantly come to mind. These cards were so ingrained into American culture there was a time when they were included as freebies in packs of gum and cigarettes. While we're a long time removed from that era, trading cards have mainly thrived since their inception. That is, until the past 20 years.</p>

<p>The trading card market seemed to stall at the beginning of this century and organizations that issue trading cards like Topps, Upper Deck, and Donruss, the leaders in the industry, all looked for solutions to update their physical products to meet an increasingly digital world. It wouldn't be until Donruss was bought by the international Panini Collectibles that we would see the digitization of the trading card space.</p>  

<p>The rise of the digitization of trading cards has triggered a resurgence within the card collecting industry. Panini is fully embracing blockchain technology, even introducing special According to Panini, they are "carrying forward the legacy of Panini Collectibles into the digital world by leveraging the revolutionary Blockchain technology and presenting you all blockchain cards."</p>
