  <p>These non-fungible kitties were sold on a market through the cryptokitties website. People we're making actual cryptocurrency from flipping cryptokitties. Later functionality allowed a pair of cryptokitties to "reproduce" to form a new NFT. These markets went wild, with people eager to get their own cryptokitty quickly scooping them up at exorbitant prices. </p>
