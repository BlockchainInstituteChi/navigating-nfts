 <p>What is the main medium of exchange when it comes to blockchains? Cryptocurrency! Cryptocurrency was designed to be fungible, as Bitcoin can be divided up to 18 decimal places. Each bitcoin acts identically to the others; no bitcoin is inherently more valuable than another, allowing for easy exchange or transfer. The divisibility of bitcoin and other cryptos allow users to purchase part of a coin instead of having to buy an entire one for near $60k.</p>

<p>Let's look at an example of a non-fungible asset. A work of art is one of the first that comes to mind. It is an asset, it has value, and it cannot be divided without affecting the value. Cutting a $2 million dollar work of art into two equal pieces does not result in you having two $1 million pieces. How could this be represented on a blockchain if all cryptos are fungible? Well, the answer is that you can't represent collectibles and real-world assets with fungible crypto.</p> 

<p>And that brings us to an important question. What do NFTs represent?</p>
