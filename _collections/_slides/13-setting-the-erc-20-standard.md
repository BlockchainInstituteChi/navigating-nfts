  <p>As we've stated, Ethereum addressed some of the inherent limitations of the Bitcoin network by allowing data to be processed by the EVM. What does this mean in practice? Developers could build their own applications on top of the Ethereum chain. These dApps would serve their specific function while referencing and contributing to Ethereum's public ledger of computations.</p> 

<p>Building upon the Ethereum blockchain became the goal of many of these projects. This coincided with a price increase in cryptocurrency, with many projects selling their own tokens to gain funding, a move away from the centralized venture capital route. Each of these projects looked to implement their own tokens as a form of reward or other economic incentive. While each of these tokens was tied to Ether, the question of interoperability emerged. These newly emerging tokens had no way to transact with each other without first transferring their tokens back to Ethereum as a middle step. The solution was to create a community standard that would outline certain specifications that tokens had to meet to become part of this newly named ERC-20 standard. Since Ethereum is a decentralized network, this recommendation had to come from the community and pass through a stringent adoption process. Since this was a good idea that was technically sound, it passed easily.</p>

<p>Now that developers had an EVM that could differentiate types of tokens, a familiar question arose: could a non-fungible token be created now that a blockchain had a data processing mechanism.</p> 

<p>Another community recommendation known as ERC-721 was on the horizon. The transition to a set of fungible token standards for Ethereum paved the way for a new standard, ERC-721 to be introduced. ERC-721 is a protocol standard put forward by the community that would allow for the creation and management of non-fungible assets. Basically, Ethereum took the concept of colored coins but applied it to its own blockchain. This new standard allowed the management of assets and digital collectibles to be managed and transferred through the Ethereum chain. Once the protocol change was made, different projects started to study how decentralized asset management could be helpful.</p>
