  <p>One of the main downfalls of the colored coins project was that Bitcoin had trouble distinguishing colored coins from regular bitcoin, mainly because of Bitcoinâ€™s inability to process or compute data. This led developers to explore other options that could maintain the decentralization of Bitcoin, but take the concept of a blockchain a step further.</p>

<p>Ethereum was heavily influenced by Bitcoin. There were certain changes made to the concept employed by the first blockchain. For starters, Ethereum aimed to be a decentralized computing platform that could perform complex functions that Bitcoin could not. This characteristic was enabled by a decentralized computing mechanism known as the EVM, or Ethereum virtual machine. The EVM would use the combined network resources to read and execute code in the form of transactions. Instead of a public ledger that recorded all transactions, Ethereum uses a public ledger that can record the results of multiple computations, along with simple transactions.</p>
