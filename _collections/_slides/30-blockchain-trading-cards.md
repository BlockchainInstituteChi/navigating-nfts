notes: <p>For starters, a blockchain card is a digital collectible that is represented by an NFT and can be transferred by using a blockchain. This creates an immutable history of each owner and each transfer of the collectible. Panini offers the ability for users to claim a card online after receiving the corresponding private key associated with the NFT.</p> 

<p>Not all Panini cards are purely digital. Some actually have a physical copy whose ownership and transfers are recorded on a blockchain. This creates a rather interesting scenario where the physical card can be sold while the digital rights remain with the original owner.</p> 

<p>Every transaction conducted on a blockchain is recorded to a public ledger. In this case, each transaction would indicate the transfer of the card. Memorabilia can derive some of its value from its history of ownership. In this case, every transfer is like another chapter added to the book that tracks the life of the card. A narrative that can support value can be established by looking at the historical transactions of the NFT.</p>

<p>Additionally, these NFTs can be packaged with different types of media, like a GIF or a video. If the card contains a piece of a game-worn jersey, footage of that game can be included as part of the NFT. This is a nice add-on in most cases, but some projects are actually looking to turn these pieces of digital media, ones that arenâ€™t backed by anything physical, into NFTs.</p>
