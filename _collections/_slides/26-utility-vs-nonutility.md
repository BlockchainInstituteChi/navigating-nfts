  <p>Let's shift back to digital collectibles. In order to better understand collectible NFTs, let's make an additional distinction. Some NFTs represent simple digital collectibles, like a cryptokitty. Other digital collectible NFTs are slightly different because they can offer something beyond simple collection and transfer. For example, some musicians are releasing their music along with an NFT that allows users to listen to the album. We've decided to label NFT digital collectibles as having, or lacking, utility. A simple way to assess this is to ask if the NFT has any other purpose beyond simple collection and transfer.</p>
