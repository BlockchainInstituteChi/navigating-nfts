  <p>A recurring theme around the development of blockchain-based projects is the inherent limitations of their networks slowing or staking the pace of their projects. Projects built on Bitcoin have suffered from the issues that limit the main chain. Often, we describe the development of dApps to be paced by the development of the ecosystems in which they are built. Once it was clear that the colored coins project was going to fail, a new blockchain was created in order to address some of Bitcoin's deficiencies.</p>
