 <p>We talked about NFTs that have utility and how they allow you a privilege that not just anyone can obtain. A good example of this would be what Kings of Leon are attempting to do with their latest album, which is being sold as an NFT.</p>

<p>YellowHeart is teaming up with the band to create a few NFTs that will serve different functions. The first unlocks a special album version with bonus content. Ownership of the NFT is the only way to access this content, giving it utility that will help maintain or increase the NFT's value. This is also the hope for the second NFT that's being released, containing a special media package similar to "behind the scenes" media. This is a rather unique way to monetize, but it only benefits the artist at the official sale. Usually, the more the piece of media changes ownership, the more people get access to this exclusive content while the artist doesn't gain additional revenue. This NFT is looking to address this specific problem through a unique smart contract that will give a set portion of each sale back to the artist, similar to a royalty paid on each sale. Artists are routinely exploited, with them having little say in the fate and sale of their work. By using this smart contract, they'll at least be able to claim continued monetization every time their work is sold.</p>

<p>The last NFT is an extremely high-level VIP package that allows the holder to claim tickets for almost any Kings of Leon performance, ever. This is quite the perk that will go for quite the price, but if NFTs can be used for a package like this, can they be used for other, more general, event ticketing.</p>
