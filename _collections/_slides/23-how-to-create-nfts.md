  <p>If you're interested in creating your very own NFTs, there is some good news: the process is pretty simple. Between creating tokens by deploying a smart contract yourself or using a service to complete creation, there are multiple ways to mint your very own NFTs!</p> 

<p>As we mentioned before, NFTs do not use the mining process to create tokens. Instead, they are created through the deployment of a smart contract. The average user can complete this process by using boilerplate smart contract code that is readily available to anyone. However, there are a few services that are offering NFT Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS).</p>

<p>The first step is to design graphics of your NFTs, which will ultimately be stored locally for reference. Once your designs are complete, it's time to pick a blockchain and turn them into NFTs!</p> 

<p>Each blockchain has its own set of protocols and code surrounding NFT governance, so you might want to do some research before deciding which blockchain will house the NFT's ownership information. The largest ecosystem for NFTs is currently Ethereum, and we'll focus on creating NFTs using that specific chain.</p>

<p>At this point If you have some experience with smart contract coding, you can deploy an ERC-721 using that method. For those of us that aren't as familiar with this process, a few projects have created solutions that not only allow you to create NFTs, but to list them in a built-in marketplace as well. Platforms such as OpenSea and Mintable have effectively streamlined the entire NFT creation process and have integrated a market on which you can sell your created NFTs.</p>

<p>These platforms are very similar. Simply head to the create a token page, upload your artwork and connect your metamask wallet to pay for the gas required in order to deploy a smart contract. Platforms like OpenSea will walk you through this process and launch a smart contract for you once it is funded. Once your NFTs are created, simply pick any market and follow the listing instructions! Congrats, your NFT is now up for sale!</p>
