  <p>The very first Ethereum NFTs happened to be issued by projects that would test out specific use cases. One of the first projects looking to transfer physical ownership records, like deeds, from one use to another via a blockchain. A special focus seemed to be on digitizing physical records that sat in record keeping offices, making sure that there was still a blockchain record of paper records that could be damaged or lost. Most of these projects saw success, as ERC-721 tokens were easily able to fulfill this purpose. Additionally, voting applications were explored as well. Each voter would be given an NFT that would be transferred to a certain wallet to act as a vote. A user would have to provide their private key to prove it was them casting their vote. All of these actions would be recorded to the Ethereum public ledger. However, these applications are not what drove 721's to popularity. That would be fulfilled by a very unlikely use case: digital collectible kitties.</p>
