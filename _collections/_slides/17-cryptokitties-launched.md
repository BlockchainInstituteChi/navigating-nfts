  <p>Cryptokitties was a dApp that facilitated the transfer of ERC-721 (non-fungible) tokens in the form of collectible kitties. Each cat had a unique set of features based on its hash; parts of the embedded transaction data would result in specific physical characteristics, some rarer than others. People went crazy for this concept, excited to participate in what many saw as a fun way to express their interest in dApps. The creativity of the concept paired with its arrival on the scene made Cryptokitties the first application to popularize NFTs.</p>
