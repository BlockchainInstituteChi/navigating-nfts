  <p>One of the most common misconceptions we've heard about NFTs has to do with how much energy is used in order to mint, or create each token. When most people hear the term Bitcoin mining, they rightly associate it with large energy consumption. This is part of the consensus process known as Proof of Work. Users agree on the transactions being processed because the miner has proven they are providing computational effort to help secure the network.</p> 

<p>Some people have mistakenly extended this process to the creation of NFTs. Since NFTs do not require a separate consensus process to be minted, PoW is not needed. Instead of the massive amount of energy expended to create a bitcoin, NFT creation takes the energy equivalent of deploying a small smart contract. Ethereum is set to transition to a separate consensus process designed to avoid massive energy consumption, but still uses Proof of Work to process the launch of a smart contract designed to mint NFTs.</p>
