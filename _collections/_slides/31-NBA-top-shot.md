  <p>Would you buy a GIF of a video that’s widely available on the internet, just to say that you “own” that GIF? Well some projects are already doing exactly that, and are gaining some interesting partners. As you might have guessed, one of those is the National Basketball Association. According to the NBA's website, "NBA Top Shot is a blockchain-based platform that allows fans to buy, sell and trade numbered versions of specific, officially-licensed video highlights."</p>

<p>What exactly does that mean? Well think of these clips as digital trading cards, just with animated card art that can't be achieved on a physical card. A highlight in GIF form can be turned into a licensed collectible, and NBA top shot is tracking ownership of these highlights via a blockchain.</p>

<p>Users will own the officially licensed GIF and can transfer ownership at any time, just as if they were trading the card to a friend. These GIFs can be sold on a marketplace, or can be traded for each other. Packs are sold through the official NBA Top Shot website for between $9 and $230 dollars and they receive the mystery virtual card or cards that are inside. It could be a LeBron James highlight, one of which sold for $71,000, or more likely something less valuable. There's a risk to losing money most of the time when you're opening packs, but the wild demand for NBA top shot actually had every pack's contents going for above pack price. This isn't the case anymore as some of the initial demand has waned, but there is still a robust market for owning these GIFs, even if they are purely virtual.</p>

<p>The trading card community already creates  $5-6 billion a year, and it's no surprise that massive sports leagues want to get in on a technology that has a chance to greatly impact a revenue stream surrounding the sport. However sports aren't the only industry likely to be impacted by NFTs.</p>
