notes: 
  <p>NFTs can usually be classified as one of two categories: digital collectibles and non-divisible real-world assets, like the deed to a house. While these physical assets can make use of tokenizing assets into NFTs, the same can be done for digital assets and collectibles.</p> 

<p>Whether it be trading cards, stamps, coins, or even cool rocks, collecting has always been a popular hobby. Now that we live in an ever increasing digital world, we've seen internet based collectibles gain (and sometimes lose) popularity. Now that blockchain technology is available, we're seeing collectibles managed and traded in the form of NFTs.</p>

<p>The purpose of NFTs is to allow these assets and collectibles to be represented, managed, and transferred on a blockchain, giving the user full control and ownership of a digital asset. Previously, expensive brokers had to be hired to facilitate the trading of assets. Auction houses take a huge percentage of each sale. Allowing these assets to reside on the blockchain gives the user sole control over the transfer of the token, without having to turn to a third party. </p>
