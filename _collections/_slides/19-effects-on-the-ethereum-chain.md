  <p>The decentralized community went crazy for this idea, and the unintentional result was that the ethereum network's ability to meet real world demand would be tested. The network was not quite ready for the challenge. The months that saw the height of cryptokitty popularity posed the toughest challenge for the network. Backlogs occurred, fees went up. The network slowed to a crawl. This made a couple of things clear. The first is that NFTs had proven themselves to be useful in terms of tracking non fungible collectibles or assets. The second was that the network still had work to do in order to scale to meet real world demand.</p>
