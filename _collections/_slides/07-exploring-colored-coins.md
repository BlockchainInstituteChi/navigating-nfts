  <p>Colored coins seemed to have significant early promise. Despite focusing on the transfer of crypto, the Bitcoin blockchain does allow for a small amount of transaction data to be included in a block. These coins would use this extra data to distinguish themselves from the average bitcoin, ideally giving users the ability to trade shares or a whole of an asset. The data signified that two transacting parties were agreeing upon what that NFT represents. Although the Bitcoin blockchain could process enough data to distinguish between colored coins and regular bitcoin, data limitations would prove to be a lingering issue for the project.</p>
