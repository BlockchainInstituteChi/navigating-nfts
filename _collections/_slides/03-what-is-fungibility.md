  <p>Simply put, fungibility is the ability to easily exchange one unit of currency for another unit of currency while maintaining the same value. Money is perfectly fungible. You can trade a friend your $20 bill for theirs and you each have the same value you began with, $20. The bill can be easily exchanged or swapped for one of equal value. The introduction of a fungible, centrally issued currency was largely the result of the difficulty of bartering using assets.</p> 

<p>The opposite is true for non-fungible assets: because of their uniqueness and inability to be divided while maintaining their value, they aren't useful mediums of exchange, usually. What are some examples of non-fungible assets? Any collectible, whether it be a Pokemon card or sports memorabilia or even a deed to a house. It cannot be easily exchanged for a practically exact copy. Usually, these Non-Fungible assets have to be sold for a fungible currency, as opposed to being directly traded.</p>
