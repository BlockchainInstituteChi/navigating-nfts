  <p>Once it became clear that the colored coins project was hitting significant barriers, other options to continue development arose. While many were focused on iterating off of the Bitcoin chain, some developers decided that a new blockchain would have to be created to solve the problems that Bitcoin developers were facing. This functionality doesn't just extend to a solution to the colored coins project, but created a new blockchain that was focused on processing and computing data. 2015 marked the creation of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
