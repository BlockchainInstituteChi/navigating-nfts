  <p>Colored coins progress had slowed significantly, as more and more developers were becoming convinced that an alternative to Bitcoin would have to be created in order to allow for functions like asset transfer/management. One of the catalysts that led to a new blockchain being created was the limited functionality of colored coins. With the adoption of Simple Payment Verification, tough decisions were made by the blockchain community as they decided to focus on how to better organize data in blocks to make the chain more efficient. The tradeoff was limiting the amount of data that the network could process in a set amount of time.</p>
