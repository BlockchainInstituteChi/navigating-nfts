  <p>Before we dive into cryptokitties, let's set the stage. 2017 saw a big increase in cryptocurrency prices, with many ICOs occurring every single day. This new funding model had really taken off, allowing users the first shot at a new project's token. As these tokens often had to be purchased with bitcoin or ether, the price of these currencies went up. Rapidly. New projects were popping up left and right, garnering the attention of many new crypto users. For the first time, average individuals that weren't crypto hobbyists were using this new technology. The only issue? Could the Ethereum chain handle it?</p>
